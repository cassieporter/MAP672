    <h1>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript programming and mapping.</p>
    <p> I found <i>Merging Criticality, Cartography and Code</i> to be an interesting read. I think that it highlights the value added that people with different skill sets can bring to the table, while also demonstrating the downfalls that specialising can bring. The move away from systematic learning and into specialised learning (particularly in the workforce) requires a great deal of collaboration with peers or colleagues to properly produce a well-informed piece of work. This is difficult to achieve (the 3 siblings in the back of the car have to agree to begin with) and often a single specialist skill is used to produce a piece of work. I agree that finding a good balance or "merge" is what we whould be aiming for to produce good maps </p>
    <p> With the evolution of cartography moving to a digital space, the new mapper should be well-informed of everything that goes into producing a map, as well as the context behind the map. This is the great thing about courses that are being released like New Map Plus. It focuses on this systematic approach to becoming a map maker.  Hopefully by the end of it, we'll all be a bit of a critic, coder and cartographer! A combination of these and the main points in the manifesto will definitely be on my priority list as I move forward in my mapping career.</p> 
    <p>Great write up Floating Sheep!</p>
